        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large white onion (diced)</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. 
            Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic
             and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh
              basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley.
               Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and
                bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water
             directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water.
              Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley,
             1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li>
